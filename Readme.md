The author needed to calculate tree edit distance. All the good explanations of algorithms were behind paywalls and the only public implementation that could be found was in a zip archive of a Java project with a broken makefile on the server of some university in Australia.

This is a [considerably] cleaned up Python translation of that Java project. [Here is the original.](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~swan/howtos/treedistance/)
