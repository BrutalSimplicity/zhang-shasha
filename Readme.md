### Estimate tree edit distance using the Zhang-Shasha algorithm

Steve Johnson ([steve.johnson.public@gmail.com](steve.johnson.public@gmail.com))

"Zhang Shasha" -> "ZSS" -> "Zzz." Get it? Sleepy? Trees? Ha!

Usage
-----

The author needed to calculate tree edit distance. All the good explanations of algorithms were behind paywalls and the only public implementation that could be found was in a zip archive of a Java project with a broken makefile on the server of some university in Australia.

This module began as a direct port of [this Java project from a dark alley of the internet](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~swan/howtos/treedistance/), which is actually an **incorrect implementation.** Email [steve.johnson.public@gmail.com](steve.johnson.public@gmail.com) for more information.
