### Estimate tree edit distance using the Zhang-Shasha algorithm

"Zhang Shasha" -> "ZSS" -> "Zzz." Get it? Sleepy? Trees? Ha!

Installation
------------

Sleepytree requires at least Python 2.5. If the [`editdist`](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/editdist/0.1) module is installed, it will be used to determine replacement cost instead of a simple 1/0 equality comparison.

Installation:

    python setup.py install

Tree Format and Usage
---------------------

Two tree formats are accepted: object and dict.

### Object Format

The tree is represented by objects referencing each other. Each node is represented by an object with at least the attributes `label` and `children`, where `label` is a string and `children` is a list of other objects.

To find the distance between two object trees, call `compare.distance(root1, root2)`.

The object format is used by the tests and is probably the easiest to work with. A simple example:

    # Node(label, children)
    # a---> b
    #  \--> c
    c = Node('c', [])
    b = Node('b', [])
    a = Node('a', [b, c])
    assert compare.distance(a, a) == 0

See `test_metricspace.py` for more examples.

### Dict Format

The tree is represented by a dictionary of edges in which the keys are the labels of the tails and the values are lists of heads. This dictionary is passed to a new `tree.BasicTree` object along with the label of the root.

To find the distance between two dict trees, call `compare.find_distance_raw(tree1, tree2)`.

The same simple example:

    # a---> b
    #  \--> c
    d = {
        'a': ['b', 'c'],
        'b': [],
        'c': []
    }
    t = tree.BasicTree(d, 'a')
    assert compare.find_distance_raw(t, t) == 0

This representation is primarily used internally, but will be more efficient to use if the data must be converted some other format anyway.
