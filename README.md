### Compute Tree Edit Distance Using the Zhang-Shasha Algorithm

If you like this module you may also like
[pygram](https://github.com/timtadh/PyGram) which computes an approximation to
tree edit distance. The difference? PyGram (which uses the PQ-Gram algorithm) is
in general much faster than the Zhang-Shasha algorithm but it doesn't given an
exact edit score like Zhang-Shasha does.

Installation
------------

Zhang Shasha requires at least Python 2.5. If the
[`editdist`](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/editdist/0.1) module is installed, it
will be used to determine replacement cost instead of a simple 1/0 equality
comparison.

The current version optionally uses Numpy.

Installation:

    python setup.py install

If you would like to try install `numpy`, `editdist`, and `nose` (for running
tests) then also run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you want to build the docs, you'll need to `pip install sphinx`.


References
----------

This module began as a direct port of [this Java project from a dark alley of
the internet](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~swan/howtos/treedistance/), which is
actually an **incorrect implementation.** Unfortunately, the author of the Java
project got it so wrong even our port was incorrect. Thus, the entire algorithm
was re-implemented from scratch based on the original paper by Zhang and Shasha.
If you would like to discuss the paper, or the the tree edit distance problem
(we have implemented a few other algorithms as well) please email the authors.

### Another Good Implementation

Another good implementation can be found on Dr. Nikolaus Augsten's site. It is
called [approxlib](http://www.inf.unibz.it/~augsten/src/) and it contains a
number of useful tree distance algorithms. Highly recommended.
