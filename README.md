### Compute Tree Edit Distance Using the Zhang-Shasha Algorithm

If you like this module you may also like
[pygram](https://github.com/timtadh/PyGram) which computes an approximation to
tree edit distance. The difference? PyGram (which uses the PQ-Gram algorithm) is
in general much faster than the Zhang-Shasha algorithm but it doesn't given an
exact edit score like Zhang-Shasha does.

```sh
pip install zss
```
If you want to build the docs, you'll need to `pip install sphinx`.
